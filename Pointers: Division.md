# # Pointers: Division of Two Numbers Using Pointers in C

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a C program that performs the division of two numbers using pointers.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Declare** integer variables `a`, `b`, and `sub`, and pointers `c`, `d`.
2. **Read** values for `a` and `b` from the user.
3. **Assign** the addresses of `a` and `b` to the pointers `c` and `d` respectively.
4. **Calculate** the quotient by dereferencing the pointers:
   ```c
   sub = *c / *d;
5. Print the result (quotient) stored in sub.
