# Pointers: Reverse a String Using Pointers in C

## 🎯 Aim

To write a C program that prints a string in reverse using a pointer.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Input**: Read a string from the user.
2. **Reverse String**:
   - Use a pointer to traverse the string to find its length.
   - Then, move the pointer to the last character of the string.
   - Print characters in reverse by decrementing the pointer.
3. **Output**: Display the reversed string.
