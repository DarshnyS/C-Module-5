# Arrays: Matrix Addition in C (Using 2D Arrays)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a C program that adds two matrices using 2-dimensional arrays.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Input**:
   - Read the number of rows and columns.
   - Read elements of Matrix A.
   - Read elements of Matrix B.
2. **Matrix Addition**:
   - Create a third matrix C.
   - For each element `C[i][j]`, compute `C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]`.
3. **Output**:
   - Print `"Sum of two matrices:"` followed by elements of Matrix C row by row.
